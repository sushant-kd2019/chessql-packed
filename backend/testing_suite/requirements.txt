# Testing suite dependencies
# Most dependencies are already in the main project requirements.txt
# This file is for any additional testing-specific dependencies

# No additional dependencies needed at this time
# The testing suite uses:
# - Standard library (json, pathlib, dataclasses, etc.)
# - Project modules (natural_language_search, query_language, etc.)
